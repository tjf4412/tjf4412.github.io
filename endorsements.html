                </a>
                <p class="paragraph">While we don't own one of these amazing safes ourselves, every customer of Liberty Safes we've spoken to wouldn't choose anything else. Liberty Safes is known for great customer service and great products.</p>

                </a>
                <p class="paragraph">Any product from Stag Arms is likely a good product. Especially recommended due to their option to have rifles and parts shipped to be compliant to various states laws and regulations. Amazing for those in states like California, New York, and New Jersey.</p>
