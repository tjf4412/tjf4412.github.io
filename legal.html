            <p class="paragraph">The state we operate out of, California, unfortunately to us and other Californian gun owners has some of the most extreme restrictions on firearms in the country. Some of the most important laws to pay attention to are California's Assault Weapons laws which deem firearms that are widely available in most other states a felony to possess in California. Below is a chart created by the members over at CalGuns that assists in understanding which accessories and configurations are legal on firearms. Some firearms are banned by name and cannot be newly possessed legally in the state, in addition to magazines which hold over 10 rounds and .50 Caliber BMG firearms. It is important to know the laws that effect you as not abiding by them could result in extremely heavy fines, jail time and even felony convictions - meaning you would be barred from possessing or owning firearms and ammunition. Below is also a link to the California Department of Justice's FAQ Section regarding firearms, which many find useful.</p>
