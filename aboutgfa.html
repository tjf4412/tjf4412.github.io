            <h2>About Gatt's Firearm Academy</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">Gatt's Firearm Academy was founded in late 2018 while the founder, Trevor Froggatt, was in his second year of college. GFA is based in Southern California, operating out of shooting ranges like A Place to Shoot, Oak Tree Gun Club, and California Tactical Academy. We offer a range of courses, the majority of which are aimed at beginners who have never fired a gun before. Some of the firearms we use during instruction are the Ruger 10/22 chambered in 22lr, the AR-15 chambered in .223/5.56, the Benelli M4 chambered in 12 gauge, and the Howa m1500 chambered in .223. Low noise and recoil rounds such as 22lr and .223/5.56 are great for beginners and can not only be extremely fun, but affordable. The company was founded with the hopes of increasing and spreading knowledge of firearms and how to safely own and operate them. Regardless of one's political beliefs regarding firearms, it can be agreed that those who do own firearms should know the basics of operating that firearm safely to prevent injury to themselves or others. </p>
