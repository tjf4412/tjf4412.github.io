            <p class="paragraph indent">Trevor Froggatt, a 19 year old born and raised in Valencia, California is the founder, CEO and head instructor for Gatt's Firearm Academy. Although he is young for an instructor, he's still spent lots of time both instructing and shooting. Finding his love and passion for instructing through teaching friends and <i>The Appleseed Project</i>. When he's not instructing, he finds himself target shooting with his two favorite calibers: .22lr and .223/5.56. He also, like almost every other teenager, enjoys playing video games while he's not at the range. What he enjoys most of all however is spending time with friends, family and his lovely girlfriend pictured above - with whom he has been in a relationship for over 2 years. Currently he is attending Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, majoring in Computing and Information Technlogies and hopes to become a system administrator/network engineer in addition to being an instructor. While in New York, he makes sure to keep his skills sharp and gets in some shooting time with his local Venture Crew, which is essentially a subgroup of Boy Scouts mainly focused on shooting.</p>
