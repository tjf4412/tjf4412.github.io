            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">We here at Gatt's Firearm Academy have a strong belief that any law abiding citizen that has the desire to become a safe and responsible firearm owner should be able to do so. Whether your goal is to hit the range and ring some steel, learn basic firearm safety, or train for self defense - we're here to help. Knowing how to use a firearm is an invaluable skill, and one that needs to be practiced to be maintained. It is the responsbility of all firearm owners to know how to safely handle and operate the firearms they own. Having the knowledge of how to operate your firearm, and firearms in general, could be crucial in swaying a potential life or death situation in your favor.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">While firearms can be invaluable tools in self defense, it's important to remember that we can have tons of fun with them too. There are countless opportunities to have a relaxed and enjoyable experience at your local shooting range. If you think you've already got self defense covered, consider taking a course in something like shooting clays, steel matches, or even bench shooting! Gatt's Firearm Academy offers courses in shooting clays, target shooting from the bench, and even USPSA style steel shoots.</p>
